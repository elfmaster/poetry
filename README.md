# The tresses of her hair

Adorned by the tender cradling of lunar beams and leaf shadows
And tracked by the intelligent hues of starlight;
Tender footsteps lead this beautious creature through the oddysseys of the forest...

She is beautiful, like an ancient dyonysian maiden under the moons pale,
But dominant influence. 

Her hair stirs within it the remants of forgotten lore...

Her eyes (Truly remarkable):
  Large doorways into a private galaxy glistening with ancient wisdom and subtle sensualities.
  They speak a numinous language of the Celtic Sidhe linage

The tresses of her hair --which is perfumed with all of the wonders-- will bleed diamond dreams
Into the fog as the mists tangle into sweet suffusions of the nights debauch
And the surrounding forest exhausts a hue of violet green auguries. 

She is as mysterious as she is warm, and harnesses every energy with grace.
Dormant reveries stir up in the hearts of men who near her, before they fall into reverent prostration

Ah yes... the mists of the forest, the grace of an enigmatic being who traces each path
with her sweet scent-- an exotic feramone that intermingles with the tremulous plumes
of each soul a`midst.

Step into the cave and see...
Step into the fields and weep
The perspective of a dandelion
The weeping of the streams below

Such is the awe of our masquerade at the center of the universe...
Which within she wears a gown of laurel and violet materials, and the mask of a dionysion maiden.
